Ruby on Rails sample API app.

It is a sample Scrapbook app where users can create "scrapnotes" and view other users notes.

Users can be:

- Admin -> can create/destroy/update and view anything.
- Normal -> can view anything but create/update/destroy only its own notes.
- Guest  -> can only view but cannot create anything.

The app is secured by basic HTTP auth and authorized based on the user role.
